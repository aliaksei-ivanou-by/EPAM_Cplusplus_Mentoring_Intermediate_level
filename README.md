# EPAM Cplusplus Mentoring Intermediate Level

# 01. Multithreading in C++ [Optional]

## Materials

Before you start (or after) It is recommended to go through everything what modern C++ offers in multithreading [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread).

Please review the [link](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread).

## Hints before start:

- Start the project as a prove of concept.
- No need to process all possible errors. Just check the count of parameters so 'source' and 'destination' parameters are present and source exists. (start with POC - prove of concept)
- Safety hint - do not overwrite destination file by default - but it is up to you.
- If you enjoy process or wants to continue: Create complete functional tool for backup process. Just pick up technical requirements for your tool from "copy /?" (windows) or "cp -man" (linux)

## What should be done

Your task is to implement simple 2 threaded "copy" tool.

- Tool should be implemented as a console application.
- Tool should accept 2 parameters source filename and target filename.
- Copying logic should be organized with help of 2 threads.
- First thread should read the data from source file.
- Second thread should write the data to the target file.

# 02. Multiprocessing Communication (Shared Memory) [Optional]

# 03. Exception Handling

# 04. Networking

# 05. Encryption

# 06. Static Polymorphism

# 07. Document/View Architecture [Optional]

# 08. \<algorithm>, \<chrono> and \<random>
